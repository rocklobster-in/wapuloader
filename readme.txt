Wapuloader replaces Contact Form 7's spinner icon with a rolling Wapuu.

== Description ==

**Wapuloader for Contact Form 7** is a really simple WordPress plugin that does nothing practical apart from replacing Contact Form 7's spinner icon, which appears when you click the submit button, with a rolling Wapuu image.

**Note:** Wapuloader works with [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) version 5.2 or higher. Also, this plugin uses SVG and CSS animation, which are not that cutting-edge technologies, but might not work on outdated browsers. *Please do not expect any practical functionality from this plugin.*
